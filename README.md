# MNIST-From-Scratch
Simple convolutional neural network built from scratch in Java aiming to solve MNIST with 99+% accuracy.

The goal of this project is to learn thoroughly and completely how a simple multi-layer convolutional network functions.  There are dozens of tutorials online that attempt to explain how to build a simple neural network that can solve MNIST, but the vast majority are essentially useless for understanding the basic concepts for a multitude of reasons.  I'd like to re-create the networks these tutorials often show and achieve the same accuracy, and eventually, the same training speed.  I'll start with creating a network that works, and then I'll move on to optimizations and easy to interpret abstractions.
